# Internshala-Web-Hacking-Training-Program

Cource Review:
It is good! They teach the fundamentals that gives a good insight to any person that is looking to pursue a career in security. I completed the course in 5 weeks. Its very detailed and they have a hacking lab too, where you can practice the skills and methods they teach. They lectures explain each concept very well. It was a perfect value for money course. Iâ€™m very happy that I decided to give it a shot.
I also suggest you to practice in Hacking labs like Hackthebox.
